### Awesome Operators in the Wild

Operators are Kubernetes native applications. We define native as being both managed using the Kubernetes APIs via kubectl and ran on Kubernetes as containers. Operators take advantage of Kubernetesâ€™s extensibility to deliver the automation advantages of cloud services like provisioning, scaling, and backup/restore while being able to run anywhere that Kubernetes can run.

This list is built by the community. Have you built or are you using an Operator that is not listed? Please send a pull request and we will add that Operator to the list.

If you want to start building an Operator, you should definitely look into the [Operator SDK](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk).
